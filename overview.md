# Incarceration in the U.S.

## Current State of Incarceration in the U.S.

### Scale of the U.S. Correctional System

[The Unites States correctional systems supervised an estimated **6.9 million** adults as of yearend 2014, representing 2.8% of the adult population. 2.2 million of these persons were incarcerated in state or federal prisons or held in local jails, while 4.7 million were under community supervision (i.e. probation or parole).](/sources#CPUS)

### Global Comparison

[The U.S. incarcerates 698 out of every 100,000 people in its general population. This represents the highest incarceration rate of any country in the world, other than the tiny archipelago of Seychelles. Countries with comparable social and economic development typically incarcerate much lower proportions of their populations. For example, Western European countries have an average incarceration rate of 90, per 100,000 people in their general populations. ](/sources#WPPL)

## Purpose of Incarceration

[Sociologists have frequently observed that governments use punishment primarily as a tool of social control, and thus the extent or severity of punishment is often unrelated to actual crime patterns.](/sources#WPPL)

### Attitudes towards Incarceration Prior to Mass Incarceration

[This is an astonishing development, especially given that as recently as the mid-1970s, the most well-respected criminologists were predicting that the prison system would soon fade away. The growing consensus among experts was perhaps best reflected by the National Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals, which issued a recommendation in 1973 that “no new institutions for adults should be built and existing institutions for juveniles should be closed.”17 This recommendation was based on their finding that “the prison, the reformatory and the jail have achieved only a shocking record of failure. There is overwhelming evidence that these institutions create crime rather than prevent it.”](/sources#NJC)

## History of Mass Incarceration

Mass incarceration was a distinct response by lawmakers and the public to:

* [Social tumult of the 1960s](/sources#WCTCD)

* [Increasing crime rate of the 1970s and 1980s](/sources#WCTCD)

### War on Drugs

#### Precursor, Not Response, to Crack Epidemic

[President Ronald Reagan officially announced the current drug war in 1982, before crack became an issue in the media or a crisis in poor black neighborhoods.](/sources#NJC)

[In fact, the War on Drugs began at a time when illegal drug use was on the decline.](/sources#NJC)

[A few years after the drug war was declared, crack began to spread rapidly in the poor black neighborhoods of Los Angeles and later emerged in cities across the country. The Reagan administration hired staff to publicize the emergence of crack cocaine in 1985 as part of a strategic effort to build public and legislative support for the war.](/sources#NJC)

## Racial Dimension of Mass Incarceration

[At current rates, one in three black males can expect to spend time behind bars.](/sources#WCTCD) [The United States imprisons a larger percentage of its black population than South Africa did at the height of apartheid.](/sources#NJC)

[These stark racial disparities cannot be explained by rates of drug crime. Studies show that people of all colors use and sell illegal drugs at remarkably similar rates.10 If there are significant differences in the surveys to be found, they frequently suggest that whites, particularly white youth, are more likely to engage in drug crime than people of color.11 That is not what one would guess, however, when entering our nation’s prisons and jails, which are overflowing with black and brown drug offenders. In some states, black men have been admitted to prison on drug charges at rates twenty to fifty times greater than those of white men](/sources#NJC)

[In the era of colorblindness, it is no longer socially permissible to use race, explicitly, as a justification for discrimination, exclusion, and social contempt. Rather than rely on race, we use our criminal justice system to label people of color “criminals.” Today it is perfectly legal to discriminate against criminals in nearly all the ways that it was once legal to discriminate against African Americans. Once you’re labeled a felon, the old forms of discrimination—employment discrimination, housing discrimination, denial of the right to vote, denial of educational opportunity, denial of food stamps and other public benefits, and exclusion from jury service—are suddenly legal.](/sources#NJC)

## Reform Efforts

### Relevant Legal Rights Preventing Racial Bias in Policing

#### The Fourth Amendment: Unreasonable Search and Seizure

The Fourth Amendment states "[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated."

**Terry v. Ohio** - [the Supreme Court found that reasonable, articulable suspicion was sufficient grounds for a police officer to briefly stop and question a citizen. Such suspicion must not be based on the officer’s “inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or ‘hunch,’ but on the specific reasonable inferences which he is entitled to draw from the facts in light of his experience.” Terry employed a “totality of circumstances” test to determine the reasonableness of police investigatory stops.](/sources#RPLCI)

**United States v. Brignoni-Ponce** - [addressed the issue of race as a factor giving rise to reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. “In this case the officers relied on a single factor to justify stopping respondent’s car: the apparent Mexican ancestry of the occupants.” Neither this single factor nor the police officer’s belief that the occupants were illegal aliens satisfied the constitutional minimum for an investigatory stop. The Court conceded “[t]he likelihood that any given person of Mexican ancestry is an alien is high enough to make Mexican appearance a relevant factor.” By itself, however, that factor did not support reasonable suspicion necessary for a roving stop. The Court proposed a multi-factored analysis: “Officers may consider the characteristics of the area ... ; usual patterns of traffic on the particular road, and previous experience with alien traffic.” Additionally, erratic behavior and evasive acts by those under the observation of the police officer, as well as aspects of the motor vehicle, may support the reasonable suspicion necessary for an investigatory stop.](/sources#RPLCI)

**United States v. Martin-Fuerte** - [Subsequent courts, however, have upheld stops of persons that were partially based on race. Border patrol agents in United States v. Martin-Fuerte referred motorists selectively to a secondary inspection area on the basis of several factors, including Mexican ancestry. Of 820 vehicles referred for secondary inspection over the period in question, roughly 20% included illegal aliens. On this basis, the Court determined that “to the extent that the Border Patrol relies on apparent Mexican ancestry at this checkpoint, ... that reliance clearly is relevant to the law enforcement need to be served.” Indeed, according to the majority, “even if it be assumed that such referrals are made largely on the basis of apparent Mexican ancestry, we perceive no constitutional problem.” But the Court cautioned against extending the logic of border enforcement cases to situations remote from the border, where the government interest in immigration policing may be less compelling. Thus, a different conclusion might pertain “if, for example, reliance were put on apparent Mexican ancestry at a checkpoint operated near the Canadian border.”](/sources#RPLCI)

**United States v. Weaver** - [affirmed the conviction of a black drug courier suspect who was stopped at the Kansas City Airport based, in part, on information that “a number of young roughly dressed black males from street gangs in Los Angeles frequently brought cocaine into the Kansas City area.” The court ruled that federal drug enforcement agents can rely on racial characteristics if objective crime trend analysis validates use of these characteristics as “risk factors” in predicting criminal behavior.](/sources#RPLCI)

**United States v. Montero-Camargo** - [The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, however, has determined that it is impermissible to take Hispanic origin into account in stops in Southern California. In United States v. Montero-Camargo, the appeals court noted both significant “demographic changes” and “changes in the law restricting the use of race as a criterion in government decision-making” as reasons for precluding any consideration of race. The likelihood that in an area in which the majority—or even a substantial part—of the population is Hispanic, any given person of Hispanic ancestry is in fact an alien, let alone an illegal alien, is not high enough to make Hispanic appearance a relevant factor in the reasonable suspicion calculus.... [F]actors that have such a low probative value that no reasonable officer would have relied on them to make an investigative stop must be disregarded as a matter of law. The Supreme Court’s contrary dicta in Brignoni-Ponce that ethnic appearance could be relevant was distinguished as relying “on now-outdated demographic information.”](/sources#RPLCI)

### Impediments to Reform

#### Higher Court Interpretations of Racial Bias

See "Relevant Legal Rights Preventing Racial Bias in Policing" section

#### Criminal Disenfranchisement

#### Private Prisons

[Approximately 129,000 people were held in privately managed correctional facilities in the United States as of December 31, 2009. 16.4 percent of federal and 6.8 percent of state populations were held in private facilities](/sources#GTS)
