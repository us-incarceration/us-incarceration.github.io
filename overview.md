# Incarceration in the U.S.

## Current State of Incarceration in the U.S.

### Scale of the U.S. Correctional System

[The Unites States correctional systems supervised an estimated **6.9 million** adults as of yearend 2014, representing 2.8% of the adult population. 2.2 million of these persons were incarcerated in state or federal prisons or held in local jails, while 4.7 million were under community supervision (i.e. probation or parole).](/sources#CPUS)

### Global Comparison

[The U.S. incarcerates 698 out of every 100,000 people in its general population. This represents the highest incarceration rate of any country in the world, other than the tiny archipelago of Seychelles. Countries with comparable social and economic development typically incarcerate much lower proportions of their populations. For example, Western European countries have an average incarceration rate of 90, per 100,000 people in their general populations. ](/sources#WPPL)

## Purpose of Incarceration

[Sociologists have frequently observed that governments use punishment primarily as a tool of social control, and thus the extent or severity of punishment is often unrelated to actual crime patterns.](/sources#WPPL)

### Attitudes towards Incarceration Prior to Mass Incarceration

[This is an astonishing development, especially given that as recently as the mid-1970s, the most well-respected criminologists were predicting that the prison system would soon fade away. The growing consensus among experts was perhaps best reflected by the National Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals, which issued a recommendation in 1973 that “no new institutions for adults should be built and existing institutions for juveniles should be closed.”17 This recommendation was based on their finding that “the prison, the reformatory and the jail have achieved only a shocking record of failure. There is overwhelming evidence that these institutions create crime rather than prevent it.”](/sources#NJC)

## History of Mass Incarceration

Mass incarceration was a distinct response by lawmakers and the public to:

* [Social tumult of the 1960s](/sources#WCTCD)

* [Increasing crime rate of the 1970s and 1980s](/sources#WCTCD)

### War on Drugs

#### Precursor, Not Response, to Crack Epidemic

[President Ronald Reagan officially announced the current drug war in 1982, before crack became an issue in the media or a crisis in poor black neighborhoods.](/sources#NJC)

[In fact, the War on Drugs began at a time when illegal drug use was on the decline.](/sources#NJC)

[A few years after the drug war was declared, crack began to spread rapidly in the poor black neighborhoods of Los Angeles and later emerged in cities across the country. The Reagan administration hired staff to publicize the emergence of crack cocaine in 1985 as part of a strategic effort to build public and legislative support for the war.](/sources#NJC)

## Racial Dimension of Mass Incarceration

[At current rates, one in three black males can expect to spend time behind bars.](/sources#WCTCD) [The United States imprisons a larger percentage of its black population than South Africa did at the height of apartheid.](/sources#NJC)

[These stark racial disparities cannot be explained by rates of drug crime. Studies show that people of all colors use and sell illegal drugs at remarkably similar rates.10 If there are significant differences in the surveys to be found, they frequently suggest that whites, particularly white youth, are more likely to engage in drug crime than people of color.11 That is not what one would guess, however, when entering our nation’s prisons and jails, which are overflowing with black and brown drug offenders. In some states, black men have been admitted to prison on drug charges at rates twenty to fifty times greater than those of white men](/sources#NJC)

[In the era of colorblindness, it is no longer socially permissible to use race, explicitly, as a justification for discrimination, exclusion, and social contempt. Rather than rely on race, we use our criminal justice system to label people of color “criminals.” Today it is perfectly legal to discriminate against criminals in nearly all the ways that it was once legal to discriminate against African Americans. Once you’re labeled a felon, the old forms of discrimination—employment discrimination, housing discrimination, denial of the right to vote, denial of educational opportunity, denial of food stamps and other public benefits, and exclusion from jury service—are suddenly legal.](/sources#NJC)

### Impact of Racial Bias on Incarceration

## Societal Impact of Mass Incarceration

### Impact on Crime Reduction

[National Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals, which issued a recommendation in 1973 that “no new institutions for adults should be built and existing institutions for juveniles should be closed.” This recommendation was based on their finding that “the prison, the reformatory and the jail have achieved only a shocking record of failure. There is overwhelming evidence that these institutions create crime rather than prevent it.”](/sources#NJC)

### Burden on Society

### Burden on Economy

[Prisons and jails costs more than $80 billion annually.](/sources#WCTCD)

## Reform Efforts

### Relevant Legal Rights Preventing Racial Bias in Policing

#### The Fourth Amendment: Unreasonable Search and Seizure

The Fourth Amendment states "[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated."

**Terry v. Ohio** - [the Supreme Court found that reasonable, articulable suspicion was sufficient grounds for a police officer to briefly stop and question a citizen. Such suspicion must not be based on the officer’s “inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or ‘hunch,’ but on the specific reasonable inferences which he is entitled to draw from the facts in light of his experience.” Terry employed a “totality of circumstances” test to determine the reasonableness of police investigatory stops.](/sources#RPLCI)

### Impediments to Reform

#### Higher Court Interpretations of Racial Bias



#### Criminal Disenfranchisement

#### Private Prisons

[Approximately 129,000 people were held in privately managed correctional facilities in the United States as of December 31, 2009. 16.4 percent of federal and 6.8 percent of state populations were held in private facilities](/sources#GTS)
